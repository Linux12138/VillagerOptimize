# VillagerOptimize
A bukkit plugin to optimize villager performance by auto remove and restore villager's AI.

Some settings for you to warn players not to spawn so many villagers which consumes a lot of cpu times. 

Before removing, set optimize_config.villager_no_ai_limit in config.yml to a very big number and let players load chunk which contais villagers to restore every villagers' AI in these chunks.
